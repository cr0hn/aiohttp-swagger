Version 1.0.15
- Fixes a bug in setup.py where the distribution exports the package tests along with the actual library.
- Latest js-yaml fixes security issue related to https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/813
- Added logic that checks whether the route.method is * or contains a single method. When the latter is the case only the method that is specified will be added to the Swagger UI.
- In the tests I replaced test_clientby aiohttp_client, as the test_client is deprecated since python 3.8.
